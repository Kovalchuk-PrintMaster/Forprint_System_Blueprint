# ForPrint Library — evening first-pass owner review

Module: `forprint_library`

Status: `FIRST_PASS_OWNER_DIRECTION_RECORDED / SYNTHETIC_MICROSTEPS_PENDING_SECOND_PASS`

## AGREED_WITH_OWNER

Library is the canonical semantic/reference layer for long-lived company truth. Any module should
be able to ask "what is the current valid X?" and get an unambiguous answer. X may be a product,
material, alias, dimension/unit, commercial-offer form, agreement/template, internal instruction,
standard, technical reference fact or other versioned reference entity.

Library must retain revision history, effective dates, deprecation, aliases and migration semantics.
It should support historical queries such as "what was current at time T?" and notify/serve dependent
modules when canonical reference truth changes.

## Working boundary

Library is not the canonical owner of physical stock, payments, active order state, CRM interaction
state or production execution. Knowledge Inventory ("what exists in our repos/capabilities") and Library
catalog ("what business/reference truth is canonically valid") are related but distinct systems.

## Synthetic roadmap expansion for pass 2

Everything below is `SYNTHETIC_CANDIDATE` unless explicitly described as owner direction.

### LIB-R0 — Inventory existing Library/reference assets
- inventory models, aliases, templates, importers and consumers
- find duplicate/shadow catalogs in other modules
- classify active, legacy, conflicting and unknown facts
### LIB-R1 — Canonical identity + lifecycle
- stable IDs independent of display names
- revision/effective-from/supersedes metadata
- states such as draft, active, deprecated-supported, retired, forbidden
- alias/synonym/migration graph
### LIB-R2 — Document/template/standard registry
- commercial offers, agreements, forms and reusable templates
- internal instructions/standards
- owner/approval/effective-date metadata
- historical and current resolution
### LIB-R3 — Materials/products/technical references
- canonical product/material/service/operation definitions
- units/dimensions/properties
- technical cards/reference profiles
- external catalog ingestion with provenance
### LIB-R4 — Typed query + discovery
- resolve current by ID
- search when exact ID unknown
- fetch exact historical revision
- explain deprecation/replacement
### LIB-R5 — Change propagation + consumer awareness
- dependency/subscriber map
- typed change/deprecation events
- consumer freshness/version markers
- compatibility for old vs new work
### LIB-R6 — Governance/audit/quality
- approval before canonical promotion
- immutable audit history
- freshness/confidence metadata
- stale-consumer reports
### LIB-R7 — Pilot and migration
- pilot one document, one material alias migration and one instruction
- connect at least two distinct consumers
- test a real change propagation flow
- expand only after evidence is stable

## Dependencies

Primary consumers: Calculator, Telegram, CRM, Operations Assistant, Accounting mappings, Prepress,
Website/catalog and other reference consumers.

## Open questions for pass 2

Library vs Contract Registry; large binary storage vs canonical pointer; push vs polling; approval roles;
exact product-catalog boundary; retention of forbidden/deprecated items.

## Target milestone

Consumers resolve current/historical reference truth without maintaining shadow semantic databases.

## Steady state

Continue measured improvement after the target milestone; the module is not considered permanently finished.
