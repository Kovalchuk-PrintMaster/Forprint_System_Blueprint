Status: MIXED — AGREED / PROVISIONAL / OPEN; NOT RUNTIME AUTHORITY.

# Cross-Module Boundaries and Open Questions

## Library as canonical semantic truth — AGREED_WITH_OWNER

Library is expected to hold foundational project truth:
- material/product semantics;
- canonical names;
- configurations;
- technical/reference tables;
- long-lived project rules;
- revision/freshness/deprecation state;
- historical-but-still-contractually-valid facts where needed.

Other modules consume Library rather than invent competing semantic truth.

## Calculator / production queue — AGREED_WITH_OWNER current direction

Keep queue/scheduling inside Calculator for now because ETA depends on it continuously.
Re-evaluate only if scheduling grows into a large independent domain.

## Calculator / Warehouse / Accounting — PROVISIONAL_BOUNDARY

Likely lifecycle:
1. Calculator predicts planned need.
2. Warehouse represents physical availability/movement.
3. Actual consumption becomes a confirmed operational fact.
4. Accounting records the accounting/financial consequence.
5. Deviations feed back into coefficient tuning.

## Blueprint / Inspector / Strategic Control Plane — PROVISIONAL_BOUNDARY

Blueprint = authority and coordination.
Inspector = observation/audit/health/findings.
Strategic Control Plane = decision support only if distinct value is later proven.

## Telegram emergency/admin channel

Concept: `AGREED_WITH_OWNER`
Authority details: `OPEN_QUESTION`

Potential users:
- Blueprint blocked-executor replies;
- Inspector operational diagnostics;
- Calculator temporary coefficient/availability overrides;
- Accounting exception resolution.

Prefer one governed transport/command policy rather than multiple incompatible admin bots.

## Shared UI / ForPrint Design System boundary — owner discussion 2026-08-27

`AGREED_WITH_OWNER`: independently developed ForPrint interfaces must converge on one shared
design-system language rather than defining unrelated colors/buttons/warnings/components.

`PROVISIONAL_BOUNDARY`:

- Blueprint owns policy/adoption contract;
- ForPrint Library owns canonical tokens, themes, component catalog/contracts and versioned
  design-system artifacts;
- UI-bearing modules consume/compose these artifacts;
- Inspector observes drift/compliance but does not own design semantics.

Website and Cloud Backup Manager are reference/inventory inputs, not cross-portfolio authority.

Propagation is "single source, controlled rollout": one canonical change feeds generated/versioned
consumer artifacts. Avoid an unversioned runtime blast radius.

## Website migration guard — explicit owner rule — 2026-08-27

The current Website is an existing, already-formed UI product and is a special migration case.

The shared ForPrint Design System **does not authorize an immediate Website redesign**.

Required Website transition sequence:

1. Keep the current Website visual design as the active production baseline.
2. Do not automatically replace existing Website styling/components merely because the shared
   Design System becomes available.
3. A new Website visual variant/theme may enter development only after explicit operator approval
   and a separate Website work package/prompt.
4. Develop the new Website visual variant in parallel with the existing design rather than
   destructively rewriting the active production presentation.
5. Validate the new variant on the Website's local development/test server first.
6. Do not publish the new design to hosting as a side effect of local development, design-system
   publication, Library updates or portfolio adoption.
7. Hosting deployment requires a separate explicit operator decision after local testing/review.
8. During transition, the current and new Website visual variants may coexist where the Website
   architecture permits, so rollback/comparison remains possible.
9. Migration may proceed gradually by components/pages/surfaces rather than as one all-at-once
   visual rewrite.
10. Only after the operator accepts the tested target presentation should the new design become
    the Website production default.

General portfolio rule:

- **newly created UI-bearing tools/modules** should use the canonical Design System from the start
  unless a reviewed exception exists;
- **already existing UI-bearing tools/modules** keep their current working presentation until
  their own explicit migration plan is approved;
- no assistant may infer "shared Design System exists" => "rewrite every existing interface now".

Cloud Backup Manager remains a reusable reference/seed for shared components and layout patterns,
not a command to make Website visually identical to Cloud Backup Manager.
